Experiment-2 View the gedit man page.Use the man -k ext4 command to find the command to tune ext4 file-system parameters. Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the text that precedes or follows the brace definition.

Approach: To view the gedit man page, use the man command followed by gedit, and to find the command for tuning ext4 file-system parameters, use man -k with the keyword "ext4". Brace expansion allows generating strings using patterns enclosed in {}, either as a comma-separated list or a sequence expression, combining with surrounding text.
